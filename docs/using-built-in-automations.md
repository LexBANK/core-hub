# Using the built-in automations

You can use built-in workflows to automate your projects.

Projects includes built-in workflows that you can use to update the **Status** of items based on certain events. For example, you can automatically set the status to **Todo** when an item is added to your project, close issues when the issue's status in your project is changed, or set the status to **Done** when an issue is closed.

When your project initializes, two workflows are enabled by default: When issues or pull requests in your project are closed, their status is set to **Done**, and when pull requests in your project are merged, their status is set to **Done**.

You can also configure workflows to automatically archive items when they meet set criteria and to automatically add items from a repository when they match a filter. For more information, see [Archiving items automatically](/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/archiving-items-automatically) and [Adding items automatically](/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/adding-items-automatically).
